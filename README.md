# Own VisionLLM Project

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a custom VisionLLM, a large language model focused on generating descriptive text based on visual input, specifically travel destinations and monuments. The model will leverage key technologies in computer vision and natural language processing to interpret and describe images accurately.

## Key Components

The VisionLLM model is structured around five essential components:

1. **Base Input (Image and Unified Language Instruction)**  
   This component combines an image with a unified language instruction that guides the model's understanding of the visual input.

2. **Language Decoder**  
   The language decoder, powered by Hugging Face Transformers, processes the textual elements of the input and generates a coherent, contextually appropriate description.

3. **Image Processor (Image Backbone)**  
   The image processor interprets the visual elements of the input. For this project, we will use ResNet-50 or EfficientNet from the PyTorch library as the backbone architecture.

4. **Language-Guided Tokenizer**  
   A custom tokenizer trained on the project dataset will link the image features to specific language tokens, facilitating seamless communication between visual and language models.

5. **LLM Task Decoder**  
   This task decoder tailors the VisionLLM's output for image-based tasks, such as generating detailed, relevant descriptions.

By integrating these components, the VisionLLM will be capable of generating detailed descriptions based on the content of an image. The model will be trained on a curated dataset (TBD) to ensure high-quality output specifically related to travel destinations and landmarks.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a VisionLLM capable of generating descriptive text for travel-related images. With a particular focus on landmarks and scenic destinations, the model will provide descriptions that capture the essence and uniqueness of each location.

## Architecture

## Technologies and Libraries

- **Dataset**: To be determined (TBD).
- **Transformers Library**: The Hugging Face Transformers library will be used for both the language decoder and LLM task decoder.
- **Image Processor**: ResNet-50 or EfficientNet from the PyTorch library will serve as the image processor's backbone model.
- **Custom Tokenizer**: A language-guided tokenizer trained specifically on the dataset will bridge image features with language tokens.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Data Augmentation**: Implement data augmentation techniques to improve the modelâ€™s generalization to a wider range of travel images.
- **Fine-Tuning for Specific Scenarios**: Additional training on subcategories of travel destinations, such as urban landmarks or natural landscapes, to improve description relevance.
- **Multilingual Output**: Expand the model's capabilities to generate descriptions in multiple languages.
